# LT2212 V20 Assignment 2

## Part 1

I split the news samples by spaces and lowercase all the words. Then I use `isalpha()` function to filter the words containing numbers or punctuations. In order to make the dataset smaller, I filter the words occur less than 5 times in the whole corpus. I get 18846 news samples and 32307 words ultimately.



## Part 2

I use PCA class in [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.decomposition) doing dimensionality reduction.
